# Prefix/Modal Bindings # {{{
# Notes on Modal Bindings:# {{{
# Unless fixed recently, sxhkd chaining doesn't work past a certain depth; having a key bound at a earlier level prevents it from being bound properly at a later level

# can't change escape key like in xchainkeys, but can do something like the following:
# have a mode entered with grave ; grave (have grave ; grave : letter bindings)
# q instead of escape to exit
# grave ; grave ; q
# 	xdotool key Escape
# 	# or some action

# used to be a bug where if you had:
# grave ; grave : u
# 	xterm
# the following binding would act like "grave ; grave : o"
# grave ; grave ; q
# 	xterm
# this would prevent the above "q for exit" example from working when used with an action other than faking an escape keypress

# there used to be a bug where if you had grave prefix bindings (e.g. "grave ; o") and added the following, double tapping grave would give about a 5 second period where you could access any "grave : letter" bindings
# grave ; grave : u
# 	bspc control --toggle-visibility

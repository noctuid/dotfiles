Fixed with -m -1 on latest versions


Problems
- Acts as qwerty versions (maybe can simulate all keys explicitly on a layer)
# - have to release and press modifier again to do more than one action (actually this seems to be okay now?)
- Gui + Alt key causes some issues with modifers being locked; using a macro doesn't work at all

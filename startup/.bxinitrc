# primary seems to be the connected monitor that is alphabetically first; ensure
# that the primary monitor stays as the laptop screen after connecting to other
# outputs by explicitly setting it

# current laptop even when connected to HDMI when starting X but may need to be
# changed if I start using displayport or thunderbolt

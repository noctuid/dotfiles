# see /usr/share/doc/ranger/config/rifle.conf

# Notes:
# - Unlike rc.conf and commands.py, a user's rifle.conf does not inherit from
#   the default rifle.conf
# - Order corresponds to precedence
# - $EDITOR must NOT be quoted if it is a program with options
#   $EDITOR is technically supposed to be a path to a program
# - The -- is no longer needed, as ranger now passes in the full path
#   (meaning there will never be a file that starts with "-")
# - Tdrop is used to hide the terminal when opening graphical applications

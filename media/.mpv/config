# "Hardware decoding is known to sometimes cause problems and as such it is
# considered "usually a bad idea unless absolutely needed" by the developers.
# For that reason and because it typically offers very similar performance to
# software decoding it is disabled by default. Moreover, depending on the video
# card, drivers installed, and file being decoded hardware decoding may perform
# differently or may not even be used at all leading to inconsistent behavior
# that can be difficult to debug."

# "The main difference between hardware decoding and software decoding is that
# in software decoding the file will be decompressed and then moved onto the
# video card whereas with hardware decoding it will be moved to the video card
# first and then decompressed. In either case, video playback will still be
# hardware accelerated via the video card."

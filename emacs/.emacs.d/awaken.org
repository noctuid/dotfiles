* Initial Notes
** Org Configuration
I moved my Emacs init file to org after becoming comfortable enough with evil to use Emacs instead of vim for editing my init file. The initial reason I switched to org was to be able to use org's outline syntax instead of marker folds (={{{...}}}=). The main reasons I haven't switched back are because I prefer writing notes using org's markup and soft-wrapping over using comments and hard-wrapping. Also, org's extra features and packages like [[https://github.com/abo-abo/worf][worf]] make org very convenient and powerful, and I like being able to easily export to other formats.

That said, using an org init file has a lot of downsides as well. Input lag can be an issue for larger org files depending on the enabled minor modes, having to first open a new buffer to edit an elisp source block can be annoying, and ~org-babel-load-file~ is very slow and requires loading org mode. Also, org's outline syntax can easily be used in non-org files, so that is not a unique feature of an org configuration.

There are ways to mitigate these issues though. After disabling some minor modes (mainly =git-gutter-mode=), input lag is not an issue for me. Using ~polymode~ allows editing elisp directly in the same buffer. Previously, ~polymode~ was completely unusable for me in large files because moving the point into a code block froze Emacs for a couple of seconds. A lot of work has gone into polymode, and speed is no longer an issue (thank you @vspinu), but my polymode config still needs work. On the other hand, ~org-edit-special~ may be desirable as a form of narrowing. Finally, slow tangling can be dealt with either by tangling (asynchronously) after startup or by [[http://www.holgerschurig.de/en/emacs-efficiently-untangling-elisp/][using a custom tangling function]]. Both of these solutions don't require loading org during startup.

** Changes From Default Evil/Vim Keybindings
As great as vim's default keybindings are, they aren't tailored towards my most commonly used actions/commands, and I don't use QWERTY, so I change a lot of them. Some of these are common swaps (e.g. =;= as =:=), but a lot of these changes are more opinionated.

*** Basic Swaps/Changes
- line movement keys swapped (e.g. swapping default =j= and =gj=)
- =Y= consistent with =D= (see ~evil-want-Y-yank-to-eol~)
- =a= and =A= swapped
- =;= instead of =:=
- =:= as ~eval-expression~ (default =;= moved to =r= prefix)
- =/= as a swiper command (default =/= moved to =r= prefix)
- =RET= for following (e.g. links or jumping to definitions like =M-.= or vim's =C-]=) and for confirmation/finalization (e.g. finalizing org capture, finalizing git commit, exiting org source mode buffer, etc.)

*** Colemak Swaps/Changes
- =hnei= instead of =hjkl= (for text editing, only =ne= are used)
- default =n= and =N= to =k= and =K=
- default =K= to =N=
- default =e= to =j=
- =H= for "jump to beginning" commands (e.g. beginning of heading or function)
- =l= as =C-o= and =L= as =C-i=; =i= is kept for entering insert state

The default =J= (join) and (particularly) =K= (doc lookup) are useful in vim; so I keep their functionality. I don't use the default =H= or =L= (which swap/move windows) at all, so I remap them to more useful commands.
I find =C-o= (~evil-jump-backward~) to be a command that deserves a better position, so I rebind =l= to it (mnemonic "[l]ast") instead of using =l= for insertion, which is a common Colemak change. For symmetry, I also remove =h=, so =hi= do not perform horizontal movement. The vertical movement keybindings are useful enough for me to keep, especially when using relative line numbers. I use a modifier with =h= and =i= if I need horizontal movement (navigation layer; not part of Emacs config). In modes where insertion doesn't make sense and horizontal movement is more useful (e.g. =mu4e= and =dired=), I keep =hnei=.

Although I now use Colemak-DH (where =m= is in the QWERTY =h= position), I still use =h= as "left." This is partially because all my configuration files already used =h= before I switchedB. ecause the idea of Colemak-DH is to move =h= to a better location, I don't think any changes are necessary.

*** Standard Prefixes
These are global prefixes that are sometimes bound in =general-override-mode-map= (whose evil auxiliary keymaps are evil intercept keymaps). =m= and =,= do not need to be bound globally since they are specific to the current major mode and group respectively. Keys like =r= that may not be useful in every major mode are not bound in an evil intercept map either. =SPC= and =t= are the main keys that are bound in evil intercept maps, so that their functionality will always be available.

Having a lot of prefixes helps to keep the number of keypresses required for a command at around two for the most common commands. I've remapped my least used vim letter keys as prefixes (which conveniently happen to also be home row keys for Colemak). =s= and =r= are probably the least generic/useful default vim keys. The default =s= and =S= are equivalent to =cl= and =cc=. They aren't useful enough to me to deserve dedicated keys. The same is true for =r= (~evil-replace~), and I don't use =R= (~evil-replace-state~) at all. I use =x= occasionally (e.g. =xp= is convenient for swapping characters), so I keep it. I never use =X=, but it's not in a good enough position for me to want to repurpose it. On the other hand, =SPC= is generally the best position on the keyboard and doesn't have a unique keybinding either (same as =l=), so its one of my most used prefix keys.

The more "controversial" keys I use as prefixes are =m=, =h=, =t=, and =T=. I used ='= a lot more than =m= in vim and didn't use =m= at all until recently in Emacs (you can persist markers, but you have to use =desktop-mode= or extract the code to do it yourself). I don't use =M= at all (~evil-window-middle~, which moves the point to the middle of the window), so I move ~evil-set-marker~ to =M= and use =m= as a prefix. As for =t=, =T=, =f=, and =F=, I prefer to use a two-char search command that will search across lines and allow selection with avy when there is more than one match (like =vim-sneak= or =vim-easymotion=). I bind these commands to =f= and =F= and use =t= as a prefix key as I can just change the characters I search for if I want to go to the character before some other character.

- =SPC=: for buffer/file/group navigation/management
- =,=: for "quickmarked" files/applications for the current group
- =r=: for "[r]emote" movement and for "[r]emoved" (or "[r]emapped") keys
  - used for remote motions (motions using avy; also used for remote text objects in =evil-(inner|outer)-text-objects-map=)
  - used for preserving some clobbered keys (e.g. the default =;=, =,=, and =/= are now prefixed with =r=)
- =s=: for "[s]tarting" applications (mu4e, elfeed, mingus, woman, proced, calc, etc.) and for "[s]traight" commands (on =ss= currently)
- =t=: previously my "leader" key in vim
  - window navigation/management
  - other general-purpose commonly used commands (e.g. ~link-hint-open-link~)
- =T=: used for one-off "gi[t]" commands (previously on =tg=; haven't completely switched over yet)
- =h=: bound to ~help-command~
- =m=: used for "[m]ajor [m]ode" specific keybindings (e.g. org commands)
- =tt=: used to "[t]oggle" options and minor modes (previously I was using =co=, but I didn't want =c= to be a prefix everywhere)

** Configuration Principles
My configuration may not meet these requirements at this point in time, but these are the goals.

- Speed (nice but not a primary goal)
  - Aggressively use autoloads and ~with-eval-after-load~ for configuration to cut down on startup time when it makes sense. Previously I had a lot of ~use-package~ statements with =:defer <time>=. I avoid this now unless I think it's unlikely I need to use a package immediately and there's no better way to autoload it. For packages that don't make sense to load with keybindings I have often copied what doom does with some minor modifications. Example differences: I am using the =evil-(operator|visual)-state-entry-hook= hooks for loading packages that just provide text objects, I'm using =evil-insert-state-entry-hook= with read-only/major mode type checks for loading some packages, I'm using a hook for when I run a keybinding to switch the scratch buffer to Emacs lisp mode, etc.). I'm also using doom's :defer-incrementally for larger packages (org, lispy, magit, etc.). :defer-incrementally helps prevent large pauses especially if you start the daemon before creating a client.
  - Configuration should work when using the daemon (e.g. some functionality that relies on GUI Emacs needs to be run later). When using the daemon, startup time isn't as important, but it should still be fast. I try to keep ~emacs-init-time~ at <0.6 seconds (when I started using Emacs, I was requiring everything during initialization, and startup could take 20-60 seconds on my old laptop). Probably I could get things to look faster if I load after init (though that will require some changes).
  - Use profiling to diagnose performance issues during and after startup.
  - Benchmark with a combination of benchmark-init, profile-dotemacs, and tracking where packages are required for debugging (see custom init.el flags)
- Intelligent handling of errors in init file
  - Localize recoverable errors and convert them to warnings whenever possible (e.g. if a package fails to install, warn and don't run its configuration). This means wrapping anything that requires a package to be loaded in a ~with-eval-after-load~ (usually via ~use-package~ or ~general-with-package~).
  - Isolate sections (source blocks) where possible, so that one section failing will not affect other sections. When there is some non-recoverable error somewhere in my init (e.g. ~(call-to-misspelled-function)~), I can start Emacs with =--with-demoted-errors= (flag I'm handling in =./init.el=) to demote errors for every source block. This means that I can still use Emacs with most of my configuration to fix my init file without needing to switch to a stable configuration or a different editor.
  - Use a stable init file for errors that break everything (e.g. missing/extra parens). I'm automatically saving my configuration when it successfully loads with a =-stable.el= suffix, and I can load this configuration by specifying =--stable=. As for package breakage, straight can handle locking versions/commits (next bullet).
  - Use ~straight-freeze-versions~ to be able to recover with ~straight-thaw-versions~ if package updates break things.
  - Don't assume that any packages besides the core packages (e.g. =straight=, =use-package=, =general=, and =evil=) have been loaded. Sections should otherwise be independent and reorderable.
  - Conditionally load non-portable functionality to prevent errors when using on other computers. Don't rely on unpushed functionality in personal packages (I was really bad about this in the past).
- Idempotency
  - Make configuration idempotent, so that any part can be run again without issues. It isn't as important to be able to reload the whole file in Emacs as it is for other software since it's more normal to just incrementally eval whatever you're working on.
- Short/Sane/Consistent Keybindings
  - As mentioned in the previous section, I prefer to have a lot of prefix keys to keep keybindings shorter.
  - I need to work on keybinding consistency (=m= keybindings are slightly different between programming modes). I plan to use and contribute to =evil-collection= more in the future to do this.
- Readability/Editabilty
  - Document issues and the purpose of any code that might not be immediately clear later. All non-trivial functions should have docstrings.
  - Use one big org file for fast/easy navigation.

I have some more package-specific guidelines listed in the use-package, straight.el, and general.el sections below.

** Style Guidelines
- Sharp quote all functions (including commands in keybindings).
- Don't enable minor modes with a =+1= argument (any argument is unnecessary when ~define-minor-mode~ is used; the mode is only toggled when the command is called interactively; this means that it is not necessary to use a lambda or named function to enable a minor mode with ~add-hook~).
- Generally try to follow these [[https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-lisp-style-guide][Emacs Lisp Style Guidelines]].

** =package.el=
Currently, I only use =package.el= if I want to use the package list buffer. I generally don't use it for installing anything.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq package-archives '(("gnu" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
                         ("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")))
#+end_src

** =straight.el= and =use-package.el=
When I first tried Emacs, I thought the idea of using centralized package repositories was interesting but was annoyed when packages I wanted to use weren't (yet) in any package archive. Alternatives like =el-get= and =quelpa= weren't quite what I wanted. =straight.el= is nice in that it fully replaces =package.el= for me while still making use of recipes from elpa, melpa, and emacsmirror. This means that while you can specify your own recipe, it's usually not necessary.

I use straight to compile/autoload my personal local packages (=straight.el= makes this easy since they are treated the same way as other packages). I also occasionally use it to contribute to packages (by directly working with the downloaded repo). Even if I didn't use it for development, having the git repos available locally is useful for many reasons. It's great to have READMEs and other files available locally, to be able to use git blame, and to be able to switch to or lock any commit.

Since ~setq~, ~add-hook~, and ~evil-define-key~ can all be used before the specified settings, hooks, and keymaps exist, I previously preferred to use them outside of ~use-package~. I didn't like nesting these inside of ~use-package~ especially for more complicated packages where my configuration is split across many headings. On the other hand, this can potentially affect startup time. I considered writing my configuration so that headings could be /optionally/ tangled into a previous =:config= section or to optionally tangle headings into a new ~with-eval-after-load~ call (specifically ~general-with-package~ provided by general.el). I decided this would be too convoluted/misleading and am now just using ~general-with-package~ manually. I've stopped being bothered with the nesting.

Here are the guidelines I follow for using ~use-package~ keywords and the order I use them in.

Package installation:
- =:straight= to specify recipes for custom or local packages

Package loading:
- =:disabled= for disabled packages (e.g. unused themes)
- =:if=, =:when=, and =:unless= for conditionally loading/configuring the package
- =:after= when it only makes sense to load one package after another (not used for "core" packages like =evil= that are loaded immediately) (usually not necessary)
- =:demand t= for packages that should be loaded immediately (e.g. =evil=)
- =:defer number= for packages whose functionality should be quickly available but is not necessary immediately (use sparingly)
- =:defer-incrementally= for packages with lots of dependencies (functionality from doom)
- =:ghook= to add to hooks that will later run and load the package
- =:mode= as a temporary solution for major modes that don't add to =auto-mode-alist=
- =:commands= as a temporary solution for packages that don't have autoload cookies
- =:general= for any keybindings meant to load the package (and not others; I use this keyword only to make it very clear how the package will be loaded)
- =:init= for any settings that need to be set before loading the package (e.g. =evil-want-keybinding=) and for function calls meant to load the package (e.g. enabling a global minor mode, setting another package's variable to a function from this package, etc.)

Note that using =:after= will put the rest of the non-installation configuration in an ~eval-after-load~ (including the =:init= section, the =(require package)= statement generated from =:demand t=, etc.). Also note that by default only =:init= can fail if the package isn't successfully installed (see ~use-package-check-before-init~); specifying =:demand=, for example, will cause an error if the package fails to install.

As a workaround, I'm setting a default value for =:when= in ~use-package-defaults~ (that is used even when =:when= is explicitly specified) to prevent package configuration if package installation fails. See [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package/issues/693][issue 693]] and [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package/issues/739][issue 739]].

Package configuration:
- =:blackout= (or =:diminish= or =:delight=) for diminishing minor mode names
- =:gfhook= for any setup configuration for a mode (e.g. set local variables or enable/disable minor modes)
- =:config= for any basic package setup; more complicated setup should go in specific subheadings

In the =:config= section, I generally put settings (~setq~ then any face configuration then ~add-hook~), then keybindings, then enabling any modes, and then any other configuration.

** =general.el=
Principles:
- Prefer using ~general-def~ or a more specific wrapper for all keybindings (more concise than ~define-key~, consistent interface to all keybindings, syntax is mostly interchangeable with builtin and evil definers, records keybindings, etc.).
- Prefer using general hook and setting wrappers (e.g. ~general-setq~ instead of ~setq~ and ~general-pushnew~ instead of ~cl-pushnew~ or ~add-to-list~; they allow recording settings/hooks and call ~defcustom~ :set functions unlike ~setq~).
- Use =:general= and =:ghook= keywords for keybindings and hooks meant to load packages.
- Use ~general-with-package~ instead of ~use-package~ if the ~use-package~ statement would only have =:config= and not install the package (like ~with-eval-after-load~ but allows automatically recording the package name with keybindings and settings). All general functions should appear in either a ~general-with-package~ or a ~use-package~ statement if there is a specific, corresponding package.

*** Ligature
I avoided ligatures for a long time, but at this point, I don't see a reason to avoid them.  I'm not going to use =prettify-symbols-mode= to prettify lambda as a single character, and I never use most of these symbols, but some of them look pretty nice without getting in the way (e.g. elisp comments: =;;=, double colon, www, ellipsis, etc.).  These don't affect editing like prettifying lambda to a single character does.

This is used for cases where you know there is a correct match in the candidates and there aren't too many candidates. Right now, I'm using it mainly for dired (like ranger's =f=), but this could be used elsewhere.

** Orderless
One notable difference between using orderless (or prescient) and some older fuzzy matchers/plugins is that space does not act as =.*=.  Spaces (by default) separate components, all of which must match.  You can still use space the same way as before (type different parts of a file path separated by space, for example), but now order does not matter.  This allows you to refine your query as needed without having to delete and re-enter a more specific query.

Unlike traditional fuzzy matchers (e.g. flx, fzf, etc.), =orderless= does no sorting/scoring.  This means you can't do something like rank initials as a better match than characters in the middle of the word for a fuzzy query.  However, sorting this way takes extra time, and I've never really liked fuzzy matching.  When I used to use fuzzy matching fzf, I never knew what to type.  I ended up just typing fragments or initials and not actually using fuzzy queries.  Initials and fragments as queries are just easier for me to construct than randomly picking or excluding letters.  Scoring on top of orderless would be a slight improvement (e.g. score a fragment that matches the beginning of a word higher than something in the middle), but scoring would be an improvement, but since you get a comparably small number of garbage results when not using fuzzy matching, orderless without fuzzy matching doesn't really need scoring to be useful.

Combined with frecency sorting, initialism is good enough for me.  Initialism is incredible for completing file paths, heading names, and function/variable names (~describe-variable~, ~describe-function~, ~find-function~, ~find-library~, company, etc.).  With prescient or orderless, if the initialism doesn't get the candidate you want in sight, you can just hit space and add another query (regexp, fuzzy, or whatever you want) to further refine.  As soon as the candidate is visible, you can use a keybinding to select it based on its index (or with something like ~ivy-avy~ or ~selectrum-quick-select~).

Of course, initialism isn't great for everything, but I've found it's often still possible to quickly create queries that are more specific than fuzzy queries but still short.  For example, if I want to pull up a help buffer for a variable in =orderless= but don't remember the specific name, I can start by limiting the query to variables prefixed with =orderless=.  Instead of typing that out exactly, I can get a good approximation by typing something like =o,s= (still undecided on best syntax; might use =o..s=) to match words that start with =o= and end with =s=.  For commands like ~describe-function~, I normally use ~orderless-strict-leading-initialism~ since I always type the first initial first.  I'm relaxing this to ~orderless-strict-initialism~ for queries after the second, so I could type something like =o,s cs= to match =orderless-component-separator=.

This can also work well for other query types where initialism is fairly useless (e.g. text search), and you can always add multiple full word queries as needed.

Even simpler is to just mash out words or partial words separated by spaces (more precise than fuzzy) in cases where initialism or orderless-prefixes can't be used.  Again, if you can't quickly construct a query, then it doesn't matter how great the matching is.  Dumb queries can often get you the result you want faster.

I'm keeping fuzzy out of my default styles, but I've configured things so that I can switch to it if needed by prefixing a query with =f;= or suffixing a query with =;f=.  If you want fuzzy matching, orderless may not be the best choice though.  I've found it can get slow quickly once queries get longer.  I wrote more thoughts on fuzzy matching in [[https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/v4rq3p/fussy_a_completionstylefuzzy_matchingscoring/ibf5yu8/][this conversation with the author of fussy]].  I did try out fussy then, but at that time the performance was just too noticeably slow for me to try it out for long.

=orderless= is infinitely customizable, so you can choose better default query styles for different commands.  If you wanted, you could remove initialism from ~swiper-isearch~ completely, for example.  I'm still experimenting with how restrictive I can make things without harming usability (e.g. can I remove ~orderless-regexp~ entirely as a default style for the first component for commands like ~describe-function~?).  So far it seems like I don't need to go this far, and I don't need any sorting/ranking to get amazing matching.

** Vertico
I've switched to vertico due to some weird display issues with selectrum. Vertico is very simple nad just works.

The only downside is the lack of prescient integration. Vertico supports recency sorting (using savehist) but not frecency. Like I was surprised to find orderless to be incredibly useful even though it does no sorting, I'll probably find recency sorting to be good enough as well. In any case, more complex sorting is best implemented elsewhere.

** Frog Jump Buffer
Useful if constantly switching between only a few files in a project. I don't normally don't keep more than 2 file-visiting buffers open in a frame, so this is useful if I'm working in a project where I'm switching between 5 or so buffers (more than that and it becomes less useful). It can be slightly faster (and definitely less keystrokes) than projectile.

** Commenting
Automatic integration with org source blocks is nice. Evilnc jumps to the beginning of the block currently. Evil-commentary moves the point to the next line and scrolls the window, which is even worse. With polymode, any commenting command should work fine in a source block.

Evilnc also has comment text objects, but they were fairly broken last time I tried them, and I've implemented my own comment text object. Evilnc is definitely more actively maintained and has tests, which is why I'm currently using it.

*** Evil Snipe and Easy Motion
Make these bindings:
- =f= and =F= in normal - 2-char sneak (avy)
- =r[fFtT]= in normal/visual/operator - 2-char sneak (avy)
- =rr[fFtT]= in normal/visual/operator - default f/t with snipe improvements (no avy)
- =[fFtT]= in visual/operator - same as above
- =[xXzZ]= in visual/operator - 2-char seek (no avy)

The logic behind these bindings is that I already don't have =t= in normal state and use 2-char seeks much more often than I would 1-char seeks in normal state. However, when using operators, I generally am not looking far ahead (deletion, for example, is normally used with a text object for larger selections and not with a motion to some arbitrary character), so it makes sense to keep the default behavior of =[fFtT]= in the visual and operator states (but with snipe's improvements, e.g. scope increased to visible buffer). If I did want a 2-char seek, I could use =[xXzZ]= (the default snipe keys for this purpose). =r[fFtT]= keys are consistent with other =r= keys (i.e. they remotely move somewhere using avy).

* Writing/Prose/Input
There is also artbollocks, which highlight certain weasel words like "very" and can give a readability score, but it's not nearly as sophisticated as other software like languagetool. I'm currently using vale over write-good and proselint, but I haven't tried anything extensively. I need to try proselint more (flycheck has integration with by default). Some of the warnings/errors these packages give can be annoying.

** Clipetty
Clipetty gives clipboard integration in terminal frames. Unlike xclip, it works fine even if enabled for a server that has both graphical and terminal frames. Currently only copying is supported (see [[https://github.com/spudlyo/clipetty/issues/10][issue 10]]).

** Hyperbole
Implicit links are occasionally useful.  For the most part, I'd rather use explicit org links.  In my case, implicit links are generally more useful for automatic cross referencing in cases where some text was not actually written with the intention of being a link.  The particularly nice ones I'm using are:
- Any elisp library in load path (e.g. subr.el; builtin)
- Jumping from a word/name/phrase/variable/function/etc. to a heading in a "wiki" org file (kind of like radio targets except multifile and automatic; defined below)

I might add this eventually:
- Variable, function, or key sequence in literal org syntax (jump to definition or execute key sequence)

How useful is this compared to embark given that I'm only using one of the builtin implicit links?  I'm not sure, but since I only need one action for these links, less code is needed with hyperbole than with embark, and I get some builtin implicit links out-of-the-box.  If I don't end up using any other builtin hyperbole features, I may switch to using embark.

** Dired
Performance notes:
- dired-k slows loading larger directories to a crawl (e.g. 0.08 -> 1 second; with all the icons -> 4 seconds; 450 items)
- all-the-icons-dired also slows loading larger directories (e.g. 0.08 -> 0.5 seconds; 450 items)

Dired-k isn't that useful, and while I really like all-the-icons-dired, I'd rather opening dired be fast.  Luckily, we now have dirvish, which is fast.  diff-hl's dired mode also seems fast, but I like dirvish's version for now.

https://github.com/Vifon/dired-rifle.el

https://github.com/thomp/dired-launch
- Allows setting a default launcher (e.g. xdg-open, open, rifle, etc.; has sane default based on system)
- Allows using custom commands for specific extensions
https://github.com/garberw/openwith
- Can match full filename (unlike dired-launch I think)
- Disowns process so closing Emacs doesn't affect it
- Affects all file finding
https://github.com/thamer/runner/
- Weird (provides commands for configuring its runner-alist but there's no harm in that; redefines dired commands without using override advice)
https://github.com/DamienCassou/unify-opening
- Uses dired-guess-shell-command for opening with other packages (e.g. org and mu4e)
https://github.com/sfllaw/emacs-launch/blob/master/launch.el
- Uses system launcher
https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks/blob/master/dired-open.el
- Uses nohup (optionally)
- Modifies ~~dired-find-file~ directly instead of adding a new opening command

For now instead of modifying ~dired-find-file~ for specific extensions, I'm just using my own command.

*** Dirvish
Dirvish is a work of art.  It is fast.  It is unobtrusive.  It is elegant.  It is all this, and it still is dired.  It is exactly what a file manager in Emacs should be.  I thought ranger was still lightyears ahead of dired, but dirvish has proved me wrong.

Dirvish solves these issues for me:
- It provides file copying/movement that is *both* multi-stage and asynchronous (unlike existing packages).  This is a game changer.
- Image preview is actually fast and usable.  I had stopped using all packages for image preview before because they didn't work well.  With dirvish, once an image is cached, it's as fast as any preview method that ranger has, and there is no flicker (unlike some ranger preview methods).  This is also a game changer.
- File preview in general works flawlessly out of the box and is customizable
- Dirvish is gorgeous, more so than ranger, but without sacrificing speed
  - The mode line is simple, customizable, and easy on the eyes
  - Icon display is fast/lazy unlike dired-all-the-icons, which is unusably slow
  - It can also replace the functionality of dired-k (very slow) and dired-git-info
  - I only had to customize one face to get it to look great with my theme
- It provides a 3-pane layout that just works (parent directory, current directory, preview).  I never used ranger.el's 3-pane layout, but I will use dirvish's.
- It provides various other helpful commands/features like bookmarks
- It is a minimal layer on top of dired and requires minimal configuration.  I had to make many more keybindings for ranger.el since it creates alternatives for a lot of existing dired commands, and I had a bunch of ugly configuration because it was comparably invasive (as both a dired user and as an evil user).

Dirvish replaces
- Replaces ranger.el (though not a ranger clone)
- Replaces dired-async, tmtxt-dired-async, dired-ranger, etc.
- Replaces dired-all-the-icons with a much more performant implementation
- Can replace dired-k, dired-git-info, and diff-hl-dired-mode (though my experience with diff-hl was much better than dired-k)

** Eshell
The nice thing about eshell is Emacs integration:
- ability to use ivy/helm/selectrum for completion and search
- evil for navigation/copying/etc.
- ability to use snippets
- intercept commands like man and ~grep <text> <file>~
- TRAMP integration (including docker container integration)
- ability to execute elisp

That said, I don't do many complicated things in terminal, so I mostly use a dedicated terminal window for one-off commands and vterm for project related commands (e.g. ~yarn~ and ~make~). Though for project commands, I try to use keybindings where possible (e.g. ~makefile-executor~).

#+end_src

** Shell
Shell has some of the advantages of eshell like ~completing-read~ integration in ~term-line-mode~, but it supports zsh and other shells.  Plugins like autosuggestions won't work in line mode (and at least with this basic configuration autosuggestions don't seem to work in char-mode either for fish or zsh). Obviously, it can't execute emacs lisp. It can run it on a remote host, but the shell has to be available there.

     (gsetq comint-prompt-regexp "^[^#$%»>\\n]*[#$%»>] *"))))
#+end_src

** Vterm
Vterm is an actual terminal emulator and my preferred method for executing shell command in Emacs. The main downsides it has for me compared to eshell and shell currently:

- There are some things that need to be polished (e.g. it changes cursor shape which is confusing when using different cursors for evil: #342)
- Every character is sent to the terminal immediately, so evil line-editing is not yet possible (minor since Emacs line-editing keybindings are more efficient, and the current behavior works with autosuggestions; sending the line only on enter would break autosuggestions)
- It does not currently integrate with completing-read frontends for completion

It might be cool to eventually replace a dedicated terminal emulator with vterm. Scrollback search, navigation, and copying are definitely better in Emacs than in any terminal or multiplexer.

- Various org presentation packages (only used once; haven't decided on one)
- hippie expand (just using company now)
- workgoups2, elscreen, etc. (switched to framegroups)
- eval in repl (never used)
- quickrun (never used)
- helm-swoop (switched to swiper)
- ediff (switched to vdiff)
- nlinum (switched to builtin line numbers)
- unfill (never used)
- weather (never used)
- anyblock (switched to targets/things)
- company quickhelp (company-box replaces it; doesn't work well with company childframe)
- vertigo (switched to using counts and relative line numbers)
- golden ratio (switched to zoom)
- multiple cursors and evil-mc (never found a great use case for)
- key chord (old usage was not ideal or saving much effort; input lag causes accidental actions)
- evil-visual-star (I don't use \* that often and a dedicated text object would be preferable to overriding \* in visual state)
- evil-goggles (really cool package but from a practical standpoint I don't need it)
- evil-anzu (using mainly swiper now which supports this functionality)
- shackle (easy enough to do what I want with =display-buffer-alist= directly)
- circe, ERC, and jabber (for now; haven't used IRC or jabber much in a while)
- shell-pop (not really using Emacs terminals at all; may add back with libvterm keybinding)
- jammer and schrute-mode (good idea but found too intrusive/annoying)
- adjust-parens (I updated lispy to have this functionality)
- cleverparens (using lispyville)
- slime (using sly)
- elisp-slime-nav-mode (using xref and helpful)
- historian and company-statistics (replaced with prescient)
- counsel-projectile (just projectile is good enough for my use cases)
